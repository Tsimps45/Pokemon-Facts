Pokémon of this type are usually connected to fear, the dark and the afterlife. They usually live in abandoned houses, cemeteries, funeral places and uninhabited dark places such as caves. Also, Ghost-type Pokemon tend to be extremely naughty, pranking humans just to see their faces and reactions. </span>

Some of them also grow berries, flowers and leaves, and many of them can control their growth. Grass-type Pokemon usually have combinations with the and Poison type.

One bad thing about them is that they can't normally come off the ground, such as Diglett and Dugtrio, even though they are pretty good combatants when they are below the Earth's surface.
